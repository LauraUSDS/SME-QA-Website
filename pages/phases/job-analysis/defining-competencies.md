intro: SMEs will clearly and objectively evaluate applicants against competencies you define before assessments begin. You'll list competancies in the job announcement as required qualifications.

In this example, the job tasks in a grouping resulted in a Customer Support core competency. The grouped job tasks were:

- Resolve technical and customer reported issues pertaining to mail routing and connectivity issues.
- Communicate and escalate across issues to a given vendor.
- Assist customers with deployment and installation of new or updated applications.

The competency definition should be 1-3 sentences long and avoid a laundry list of specific tasks. Competancies should explain what it looks like when an applicant has that skill. Based on the job tasks, the definition for Customer Support is:

> *Customer Support: Works with external and/or internal customers in a large, geographically dispersed organization to assess needs, provide information or assistance, and resolve their problems. Knows how to best utilize ticketing systems. Is committed to providing quality products and services.*

When defining your competencies, you may find it helpful to refer to existing competency definitions like the OPM qualification standards for the series you're hiring for. Edit those definitions to match the requirements your workshop group has determined are necessary for your posted position.

#### Weighting competencies

In the first round of SME-QA pilots, all competencies were equally weighted. If the SMEs felt one competency mattered less than the others, then a lower lower proficiency level was required. If the SMEs felt a competency was not required at all, they removed it from the qualifications.
