The SMEs should decide which assessment types make sense to evaluate each competency and then create assessments (interview questions and/or written prompts) to assess the identified proficiency levels.

As a best practice, applicants should pass through multiple hurdles with multiple SMEs before an agency considers them qualified. In order to eliminate unqualified applicants in each round, the two rounds should measure different things. For example, one interview can measure breadth of knowledge and the second interview can measure depth of knowledge. Or, a written demonstration project can measure technical competencies while a phone interview measures competencies more easily assessed through oral communications. Therefore, any applicant who doesn't receive a high enough score during the first assessment will not progress to the second. 

Use your defined competencies, proficiencies, and required experience to create guidance for SMEs reviewing applicant responses.

### Assessment Options (all pass/fail)

During job analysis you will select additional assessment hurdles to measure an applicant's competencies. For example:
  
  - Work Samples (these can be requested at the time of application)
  - Written Assessments
  - Structured Interviews
  - USAHire Assessments
  
You should discuss options thoughtfully with hiring managers before the job analysis workshop, then plan the content of the assessments with SMEs during that workshop. If you have more than one assessment then they must measure two different things. This allows you to disqualify applicants from the second assessment if they don't pass the first.

If you are creating a new passing score work simulation assessment, think through the following:
  - Is the assessment linked to the job analysis of what is required to do the job from day one?
  - You are required to include awareness of this passing score assessment hurdle in the job announcement language under "how you will be evaluated." Make it clear applicants must pass the assessments to be considered qualified.
  - The scoring for the assessment must be clear so itâ€™s obvious to all SMEs which applicants pass and which do not.

## Written Assessments Tips
- The assessment type should be appropriate to evaluate the applicant's proficiency level within the examined competencies.
- Ideally, you will have time during the workshop for live testing of the assessment questions. If you end up revising the assessment after the workshop, the revised assessment will need to be tested.
- You should as part of testing record the time it will take to conduct the written assessment and added that to the job announcement.
- You should provide an estimated timeframe in which to expect a written assessment will be sent out on the JOA (e.g., "If you are selected to move forward, you should expect to receive a written assessment within approximately 3-5 days of this announcement closing."

### If Using Two Live Interviews

**Phone Assessment Interview 1** tests the applicant's *breadth of experience* by evaluating their basic knowledge across all required competencies. Write one question per competency and include follow-up questions to determine whether the applicant meets the required proficiency level. Breadth questions tend to take five to ten minutes to answer, including any follow-up questions.

**Phone Assessment Interview 2** tests the applicant's *depth of knowledge* across all required competencies. Depth questions test how an applicant reacts and responds to changes in the presented situation. Depth interview questions can cover one to two competencies per question, and should include multiple follow-up questions that add complexity to the original question, such as "Now imagine...". These questions can take 10-15 minutes for an applicant to answer, including follow-up questions.

### Types of Interview Questions

Ask applicants questions about *past experience*, a *hypothetical situation*, and *applicant viewpoint*. In all cases, you can establish additional *probe questions* help SMEs to draw out more information, such as "What was your role?" or "Can you tell me more?"

- **Past Experience:** Ask the applicant for a story from their work experience that describes the required level of proficiency (for example, "Tell me about a time..."). A qualified applicant will give specific and detailed answers, including the events leading up to the story, why they made the decisions they did, the lessons they learned, and what they would do differently.
- **Hypothetical Situation:** Give the applicant a situation they are likely to encounter in the role you're interviewing for (for example, "Imagine we have a problem with..."). Ask them to analyze what might be the cause, develop a plan or solution, or describe the pros and cons of a proposed approach. The setup to this question may be longer than other types and might be based on real challenges their organization has faced in the past. Ground a hypothetical situation in an applicant's own experience by always including a follow-up question, such as "Can you tell me about a time you experienced a similar situation in your recent work experience?"
- **Applicant Viewpoints:** Ask the applicant's opinion about an issue with different schools of thought (for example, "What do you think about..."). Assess the applicant on their ability to justify their perspective, or if they lack a strong preference one way or other, to identify and contrast different opinions.

To get the best information about an applicant, related to the competencies and proficiencies you've documented, avoid creating these types of questions.

- **Brain teasers or puzzles** create stress for the applicant and don't test their skills.
- **Self-assessing strengths and weaknesses** creates disingenuous answers that don't relate to competencies.
- **Five-year plans and future goals** don't test competencies and can reveal inappropriate information that introduces bias.
