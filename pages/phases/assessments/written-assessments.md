If your SMEs opt for a written assessment instead of a first-round interview, you will need to prepare questions and training for each different assessment round.


### Items to check before sending a written assessment
#### Communication to applicants
- Applicants may be concerned you are seeking "free work" - have you clearly explained that the asseessment is solely for evaluation?
- Have you expressed the due date of the assessment consistently, with time zone marked?
- Have you clarified any formatting requirements for submission and what will happen if people submit via another format?
- Have you added language about how you will treat extenuating circumstances (e.g. a COVID infection)?

#### Assessment readiness
- Have you had one SME who has not worked on developing the written assessment attempt to take it in order to gauge difficulty level and time to complete?
- Have you built out instructions for how to transmute the assessment scores, particularly if you have multiple reviewers? (the SME-QA team has a template you can reference)
