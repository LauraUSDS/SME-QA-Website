If your SMEs opt for a written assessment instead of a first-round interview, you will need to prepare questions and training for each different assessment round.

The assessment type should be appropriate to evaluate the applicant's proficiency level within the examined competencies.

### Assessment Options

- Whiteboarding exercise
- Structured essay
- Unstructured essay (short responses or long responses)
