If your SMEs opt for a written assessment instead of a first-round interview, you will need to prepare questions and training for each different assessment round.

The assessment type should be appropriate to evaluate the applicant's proficiency level within the examined competencies. Applicants may be concerned you are seeking "free work" - so clearly explain that the asseessment is solely for evaluation.

### Items to check before sending a written assessment
- Have you expressed the due date of the assessment consitantly, with timezone marked?
- Have you clarified any formatting requirements for submission and what will happen if people submit via another format?
- Have you built out instructions for how to transmute the assessment scores, particularily if you have multiple reviewers?
- Have you tested the time it will take to conduct the written assessment and added that to the job announcement?
- Have you provided an estimated timeframe in which to expect a written assessment will be sent out on the JOA (e.g., "If you are selected to move forward, you should expect to receive a written assessment within approximately 3-5 days of this announcement closing."
- Have you added language about how you will treat extenuating circumstances?
