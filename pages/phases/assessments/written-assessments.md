intro: During job analysis, SMEs and HR may decide to use a written assessment.

Written assessments can be used before or after resume review. If your SMEs opt for a written assessment, you will need to prepare questions and training. SMEs do not need to review a written assessment for all competancies if it is failing for a required competancy. 

### Templates
- The [written assessment guidance document](../../../toolkit/assessments/written-assessment-guidance.docx) has information about types of written assessments.
- The [written assessment scoring sample document](../../../toolkit/assessments/written-assessment-guidance.docx) is a sample scoring template. You should expect to edit this heavily based on what SMEs determine in job analysis.


### Items to check before sending a written assessment
#### Communication to applicants
- Applicants may be concerned you are seeking "free work" - have you clearly explained that the asseessment is solely for evaluation?
- Have you expressed the due date of the assessment consistently, with time zone marked?
- Have you clarified any formatting requirements for submission and what will happen if people submit via another format?
- Have you added language about how you will treat extenuating circumstances (e.g. a COVID infection)?
- Have you decided if you will provide applicants with SME feedback about their written assessment submissions? (in other words, do you want to share information about why assessments failed?)

#### Assessment readiness
- Have you had one SME who has not worked on developing the written assessment attempt to take it in order to gauge difficulty level and time to complete?
- Have you built out instructions for how to transmute the assessment scores, particularly if you have multiple reviewers? (the SME-QA team has a template you can reference)

### Use in fit interviews
- We suggest making written assessments available to hiring managers when they are evaluating a certificate, so they can see a sample of the applicant's work. You can also provide the comments from the SME in reviewing the assessment.
