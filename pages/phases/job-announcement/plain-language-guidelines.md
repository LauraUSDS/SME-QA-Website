Use plain language throughout your announcement (it's the law!). For more information, see "[Plain Language](https://content-guide.18f.gov/plain-language/)" from the *18F Content Guide*.

- Mark any government-specific terms and either remove any that are unnecessary or explain those that must be mentioned.
- Use pronouns to personalize the content and experience. For example, use “you” and “your” when speaking to the job seeker, instead of terms like “incumbent” or “candidate”.
