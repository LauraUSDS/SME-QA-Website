-	Read the reviews for any notes that do not mention a specific missing competency or proficiency level as the basis for not moving an applicant forward.  Any notes that do not follow this requirement should be sent back to the SME.
-	HR is not second guessing the judgment of the Subject Matter Expert through their own review but is rather ensuring the validity of the justification reason listed.
-	Ensure that any time two SMEs disagree on the resume review outcome, a third SME is invited to break the tie.
