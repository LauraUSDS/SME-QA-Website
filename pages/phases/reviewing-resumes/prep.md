intro: Before you train subject matter experts to review resumes, prepare the applications that they'll review, as well as the talent acquisition system (TAS) accounts they'll need. This allows the SMEs to begin reviewing resumes immediately after they're trained.

Before you send resumes to SMEs for review, mark applicants as ineligible if:

- They do not have a resume.
- They do not meet the citizenship requirement, if not automatically filtered for your agency.

Instead of reviewing resumes to determine minimum qualification, review the technical justification that SMEs provide to make sure their decision can be retraced later on. As HR specialist, you'll adjudicate veterans' preference after SMEs conduct phone assessment interviews.

### Create Applicant Lists for SME Reviews

In previous SME-QA pilots, two SMEs independently reviewed each applicantâ€™s resume to determine whether they adequately reflect the required competencies and proficiencies, with a third SME conducting tiebreaker resume reviews if needed. If an agency wants to tweak this process, they should do so during their job analysis workshop.

1. Decide how SMEs will review resumes. Either SMEs can review resumes and provide ratings directly within your TAS, or you can download all resumes for SMEs to conduct reviews outside your TAS.
2. Divide applicants evenly among participating SMEs, assigning two SMEs to review each applicant's resume. For example, if you have 100 applicants and 6 SMEs, create two lists of 50 applicants and assign two SMEs to review each list. The additional two SMEs will conduct tiebreaker reviews only. If SMEs will use your TAS, create separate stored lists for each group of SMEs. If you'll export the applicant list and resumes on behalf of the SMEs, use a tracking spreadsheet to assign two SMEs to review each applicant.
3. If multiple roles or parentheticals are available for your hiring action, make sure the applicant's choices are clear to the SMEs before they begin resume review as there may be extra role-specific competencies for the SME to consider during their reviews.
