phase: getting-started
intro: After deciding to use the SME-QA process to find qualified applicants, plan your hiring action.
roles: [hr, hiring-mgr]
outputs:
#### Required
- Identify a classified position description (PD) at the proper GS level 
- SMEs dedicate time to work with HR on setting the qualifications and the assessment plan.
- The minimum qualifications are competency based. Even if there is an education requirement, the applicant must still prove they meet the required proficiency level for each competency through qualification assessments in ordered to be considered eligible.
- Identified pilot point of contact at the agency. Need to be accountable.
- Using your knowledge of the applicant pool, your openings, your assessments, and your timeline, determine the number/range of SMEs needed for your hiring action.
- A hiring manager willing to spend SME time on developing/using assessment hurdles.
- Use best in class SMEs.

#### Highly Recommend
- Have a plan to gather baseline data on recent delegated examination (DE) hiring actions
  - Current qualified rate
  - Current referral rate
  - Current selection rate

#### Best Practice
- SME-QA should generally be for a technical role and GS12-15.
- A hiring manager who is unsatisfied with the quality of previous certificates received for the same grade/series and therefore is willing to spend SME time on additional assessment hurdles.
- Have a dedicated HR specialist and project manager work together to plan your hiring action timeline.
- Host a kick off meeting with SMEs, HR, and hiring managers to ensure everyone is on the same page about the process, goals, and time commitment.
- Measure hiring funnel (# applicants progress through each phase + selections) & elapsed phase time (track the start and end time for each phase).

#### Pro-tips
- If kick-off meeting isn't an option, email overview presentation of the process to SMEs, HR, and hiring managers.
- Spend minimal effort reclassifying a PD. The job analysis is the bridge between the PD and job announcement.
