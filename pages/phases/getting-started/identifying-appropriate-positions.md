### Identifying a Classified Position Description

Your position description (PD) should reflect adequate specialized experience to require the time and effort of SMEs. Rather than classifying a new PD, we encourage using a standardized PD since your in-depth job analysis workshop will link the PD to an accurate job announcement. The competencies identified through the job analysis workshop simply need to be rooted in the PD. <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">Page 3-12 of the updated DE Handbook clarifies</a>:

<blockquote>"Conditions of employment should be supported in the position description and/or by job analysis."</blockquote>


### Identify Billets

Our research suggests that the typical cost to hire a new full time employee in industry is $4000-$5000. One pilot agency spent ~$13000 (in personnel costs) on their hiring action, which onboard four people, suggesting a cost per hire of $3250. Other pilots have spent between $2500 and $6900 per hire on their SMEQA pilots.

In order to be cost efficient, you should have approved headcount of three or more GS-12+ billets for the same technical role; however, five or more is recommended to achieve cost efficiency. Fewer billets presents a higher risk of spending above the industry average, though your agency may accept that cost for certain roles.

To make the effort more worthwhile, you can share your certificate with another office or agency with vacancies for the same position. If doing this, consider bringing on SMEs from that office to help minimize individual burden.
