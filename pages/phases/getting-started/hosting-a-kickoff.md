After you have your position defined and your SMEs selected, host a kick off meeting to get everyone on the same page. You may want to involve agency leadership in this meeting for their viability on this hiring action. 

At this meeting, review an overview presentation of the process (link), go over the principles about the process, and discuss the anticipated timeline and time commitment. The next meeting after this will be the 2.5 day job analysis workshop.
