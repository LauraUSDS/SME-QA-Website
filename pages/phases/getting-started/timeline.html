intro: In your first use of SME-QA, target an eight week timeline from the job analysis workshop to selections. In subsequent postings of the same role, five weeks is possible. This timeline requires a project manager, HR specialist, and SMEs committed to this schedule, and hiring managers committed to making quick selections given the amount of quality assessments.
