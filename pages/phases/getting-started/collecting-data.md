## Collecting baseline data

<p class="usa-intro">
  {{ page.intro }}
</p>

To gauge the success of your hiring action, collect baseline data about recent hiring actions at your agency. If you plan a delegated examination (DE) pilot, you will want to collect data from past DE actions, and so forth. You'll compare this information with the results you receive when your new hiring action is complete. If you share this data with us we can help you analyze the data and evaluate your results.

For one to two recent DE actions for a similar GS level and series to the position you plan to fill, gather:

1. **Current qualified rate**: How many applications were considered qualified by an HR specialist.
2. **Current selection rate**: The number of selections made off of the resulting certificates, represented numerically and as a percentage of qualified applications.

Use our <a href="{{site.baseline}}/toolkit/getting-started/baseline-data-to-collect.xlsx">baseline data spreadsheet</a> in order to request data from your Talent Acquisition System. 

For USA Staffing customers, you can pull your baseline data by clicking the “Certificate Selection by Assessment Category” report in Cognos. It is located in the Team Content > USA Staffing Packages and Folders > Staffing Reports > Staffing > Certificate folder. To export the report, click the “…” symbol to the right of the report’s name, and select “Run As”.  A menu will appear with options to run as Excel among others. The excel file will automatically download to the Downloads folder on your computer.  

## Measuring your process

<p class="usa-intro">
  To gauge the success of the hiring process, measure applicant flow through the process and confidence in the process.
</p>

1. **Hiring funnel**: How many applicants progress through each phase.
2. **Level of burden**: Have internal resources track their time: SMEs, HR, hiring manager, schedulers, project managers.
3. **Elapsed phase time**: Track the start and end time for each phase.

## Measuring your results

<p class="usa-intro">
  To gauge the success of your hiring action, measure applicant quality and the applicant pool.
</p>

1. **Selections**: How many applicants make it onto certificates by category and how many applicants are ultimately selected by a hiring manager.
2. **Adverse impact**: Track demographics of the applicant pool after each phase. Demographics include race and gender. Also, track eligibility data such as federal employees, Veterans, etc.

## Measuring ultimate success

<p class="usa-intro">
  To gauge the ultimate success of your new hires, measure employee performance on the job and retention.
</p>

1. **Quality of performance on the job**: Capture performance review ratings for new employees.
2. **Hiring manager satisfaction**: Interviews with hiring managers after the first quarter, mid-year, and end of year performance evaluation of new hires.
