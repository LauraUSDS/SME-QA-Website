          Improving Fair and Open Access for All Applicants
        </p>
        <p>
          The SME-QA process is an alternative to the traditional resume review and assessment process. With it, SMEs allow hiring managers to hire highly qualified talent. Key details include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clean, simple USAJOBS announcement template that is more narrowly tailored to the job requirements, similar to private sector standards.</li>
          <li>The ability to limit the number of resume pages that SMEs will review, removing the common practice of submitting long, overly comprehensive resumes that favor individuals intimately familiar with federal hiring practices.</li>
          <li>Structured SME assessment interviews that replace the self-reported, and often over-inflated, applicant occupational questionnaire. These interview assessments allow experts in the role to mark unqualified any applicant who does not meet the required technical qualifications.</li>
          <li>Minimal burden on participating SMEs, such as allowing brief but retraceable justifications and allowance for a single SME to conduct each structured phone interview.</li>
          <li>An assessment strategy that enforces a passing score on SME interviews before determining qualification, after which point veteransâ€™ preference and category rating rules apply.</li>
          <li><strong>Empower SMEs to make qualification determinations on technical competencies.</strong> HR specialists review the justifications from SMEs to make sure the decisions are retraceable and that the SMEs have documented the specific competencies that the applicant doesn&#39;t meet. HR specialists defer to the SMEs judgment for these decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Create accurate job announcements on USAJOBS</strong> that represent the position and are not copied directly from the position description.</li>
          <li><strong>Replace the self-reported, and often over-inflated, occupational questionnaire</strong> with SME resume review and assessments.</li>
          <li><strong>Limit the number of pages of work experience that would be reviewed on resumes</strong> to level the playing field for private sector applicants and reduce burden on SMEs conducting reviews.</li>
          <li><strong>Applicants who pass SME resume review earn entry to the assessment</strong>. These assessments, rather than resume review, determine whether the applicant is qualified. After assessments are completed, all veterans&#39; preference and category rating rules apply. Preference is adjudicated after applicants pass all hurdles (resume review and typically two assessment rounds).</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce burden on participating SMEs</strong>, for example by allowing minimal justification documentation when reviewing resumes, by permitting a single SME to conduct an individual assessment, and only doing a second assessment round for those who pass the first round.</li>
        </ul>
