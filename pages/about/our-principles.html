        <ul>
          <li><strong>Empower SMEs to make qualification determinations on technical competencies.</strong> HR specialists review the justifications from SMEs to make sure the decisions are retraceable and that the SMEs have documented the specific competencies that the applicant doesn&#39;t meet. HR specialists defer to the SMEs judgment for these decisions.</li>
          <li><strong>Create accurate job announcements on USAJOBS</strong> that represent the position and are not copied directly from the position description.</li>
          <li><strong>Replace the self-reported, and often over-inflated, occupational questionnaire</strong> with SME resume review and assessments.</li>
          <li><strong>Limit the number of pages of work experience that would be reviewed on resumes</strong> to level the playing field for private sector applicants and reduce burden on SMEs conducting reviews.</li>
          <li><strong>Applicants who pass SME resume review earn entry to the assessment</strong>. These assessments, rather than resume review, determine whether the applicant is qualified. After assessments are completed, all veterans&#39; preference and category rating rules apply. Preference is adjudicated after applicants pass all hurdles (resume review and typically two assessment rounds).</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce burden on participating SMEs</strong>, for example by allowing minimal justification documentation when reviewing resumes, by permitting a single SME to conduct an individual assessment, and only doing a second assessment round for those who pass the first round.</li>
