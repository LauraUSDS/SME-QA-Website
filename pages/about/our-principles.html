          The SME-QA process is an alternative to the traditional resume review and assessment process. With it, SMEs allow hiring managers to hire highly qualified talent. Key details include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A clean, simple USAJOBS announcement template that is more narrowly tailored to the job requirements, similar to private sector standards.</li>
          <li>The ability to limit the number of resume pages that SMEs will review, removing the common practice of submitting long, overly comprehensive resumes that favor individuals intimately familiar with federal hiring practices.</li>
          <li>Structured SME assessment interviews that replace the self-reported, and often over-inflated, applicant occupational questionnaire. These interview assessments allow experts in the role to mark unqualified any applicant who does not meet the required technical qualifications.</li>
          <li>Minimal burden on participating SMEs, such as allowing brief but retraceable justifications and allowance for a single SME to conduct each structured phone interview.</li>
          <li>An assessment strategy that enforces a passing score on SME interviews before determining qualification, after which point veteransâ€™ preference and category rating rules apply.</li>
        </ul>
