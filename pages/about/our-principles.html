        <h2 class="smeqa-principle" id="empower-smes">
          Empower SMEs to make qualification determinations on technical competencies
        </h2>
        <p>
          HR specialists review the justifications from SMEs to make sure the decisions are retraceable and that the SMEs have documented the specific competencies that the applicant doesn't meet. HR specialists defer to the SMEs judgment for these decisions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="smeqa-principle" id="accurate-joa">
          Create accurate job announcements on USAJOBS
        </h2>
        <p>Create accurate job announcements that represent the position and are not copied directly from the position description.</p>

        <h2 class="smeqa-principle" id="replace-questionnaire">
          Replace the self-reported, and often over-inflated, occupational questionnaire
        </h2>
        <p>
          Replace the self-reported, and often over-inflated, occupational questionnaire with SME resume review and assessments.
        </p>

        <h2 class="smeqa-principle" id="limit-resume-pages">
          Limit the number of pages of work experience that would be reviewed on resumes</h2>
        <p>
          Limit the number of pages of work experience that would be reviewed on resumes to level the playing field for private sector applicants and reduce burden on SMEs conducting reviews.
        </p>

        <h2 class="smeqa-principle" id="earn-entry-to-assessment">
          Applicants who pass SME resume review earn entry to the assessment
        </h2>
        <p>
          These assessments, rather than resume review, determine whether the applicant is qualified. After assessments are completed, all veterans' preference and category rating rules apply. Preference is adjudicated after applicants pass all hurdles (resume review and typically two assessment rounds).
        </p>

        <h2 class="smeqa-principle" id="reduce-burden-on-smes">Reduce burden on participating SMEs</h2>
        <p>
          For example by allowing minimal justification documentation when reviewing resumes, by permitting a single SME to conduct an individual assessment, and only doing a second assessment round for those who pass the first round.
