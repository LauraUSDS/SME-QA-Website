<p class="usa-intro">
  In the second round of pilots the team focused on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">refining the SME-QA applicant funnel</a>, how applicants move between assessment phases, by swapping the first interview out for written assessments and asynchronous interviews. The team also created a Resume Review Tool.
</p>

<h2>By the numbers</h2>
<p>
  The team continues to focus on measuring the most important metric: the number of selections hiring managers made from the certificates, indicating the quality of the certificates.

<h3>Private vs. Public Sector Applicants</h3>
<p>
  In support of fair and open competition, the team worked to put private sector applicants on equal footing with applicants who are familiar with the strategies for successfully navigating the federal application process. USA Staffing doesnâ€™t currently track whether applicants come from the private or public sector, limiting the availability of baseline data. The team did, however, review every resume received for both pilot hiring actions to learn whether SMEs found private sector applicants qualified throughout the applicant funnel.
