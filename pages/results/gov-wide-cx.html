<p class="usa-intro">
  The CX Hiring Action Pilot was a federal government Customer Experience initiative spearheaded by the U.S. Digital Service, collaborating with several offices government wide, to conduct a recruitment effort for the Customer Experience (CX) position at the GS-13, 14, and 15 levels and bring in qualified talent through a streamlined hiring process.

<p>
  Over a period of two months, USDS partnered with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget to bring in Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) across agencies in the initial stages of the pilot, to help define the role description, including proficiencies and competencies. After the qualification review phase, we moved forward to notify agencies, determined how many open positions at each level they would like to fill, interview, and finally, allow agencies to hire from the selected pool of candidates.

<p>
  The main goal of this pilot was to assist government agencies reform their hiring process, eliminate the burden on HR managers struggling to recruit and select top talent for CX roles, and transform the way we deliver services within government.

  Twelve federal agencies and their components took part in this hiring pilot, and thirteen SMEs assisted with a virtual resume review training. The CX job posting was announced via several social media platforms, went live on performance.gov, and was posted on the USAJOBS website.
