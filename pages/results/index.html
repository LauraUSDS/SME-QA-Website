<h2>Round One Pilots</h2>
<p>
  Through the spring of 2019, the team tested the SME-QA process with two pilots at <a href="{{hhs.abbrev | prepend: site.baseurl }}/">{{ hhs.name }} ({{hhs.abbrev | upcase}})</a> and <a href="{{doi.abbrev | prepend: site.baseurl }}/">{{ doi.name }} ({{ doi.abbrev | upcase }})</a>, both focused on improving the quality of applicants who appear on certificates. In addition, while time to hire was not a focus of these pilots, it will be critical as the SME-QA process scales. To measure the success of the pilots, the team gathered baseline data to compare with data from each agency pilot.
</p>
<p>
  The most important metric the team tracked was the number of selections hiring managers made from the certificates, indicating the quality of the certificates. Because the SME-QA process gradually eliminates applicants who Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) do not find qualified, hiring managers received a shorter list of qualified applicants. In both pilots, fewer applicants were deemed qualified but more applicants were selected. 
</p>

<h2>Round Two Pilots</h2>
<p>
  Over the course of 2020 the team has refined the process with pilots at the following agencies:
</p>

<ul>
{% for agency in round_two_agencies %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ agency.abbrev | prepend: site.baseurl }}/">
      {{ agency.name }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
